## Directions to the Lab from the Bern Train Station (Hauptbahnhof):

The lab it is only 10' walking distance from the station. Here are some guidelines on how to get there:
1) First, when you exit the train, continue in the forward direction, until you see some escalators going upon an upper transversal platform (cf picture). Do not go down to the main hall of the station as it is then much more difficult and longer to get to your hotel.
2) Once on the platform, go right (North) and take some further escalators going up at its extremity. At this stage you should be on Schanzenstrasse, a street that goes up.
3) So go up on that street, until you reach a plateau (100m) and continue on the same street (now called Langgasse). Turn left at the Restaurant Beaulieu (Erlachstrasse) and continue until a roundabout. More details : https://goo.gl/maps/Yi22LkdsGZ6KVj2s7.
